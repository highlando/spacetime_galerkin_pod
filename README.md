Multidimensional Galerkin POD
---

Repository of helper and core functions for multidimensional Galerkin POD reduction.

The basic functionalities relies on

 * tensors as multidimensional arrays
 * higher-order SVD (HOSVD)
 * consideration of mass matrices (to be inline with underlying function spaces
   and Galerkin projections in a suitable inner product)
